## Question 3

# assumption 3: otherwise, I'm still fine unless it's raining and it's a workday == I'll be fine if it's not raining or it's not a workday.
# To prove that prepared_for_weather is buggy, come up with a set of inputs where either:
# the function returns False (but should have returned True), or the function returned True (but should have returned False).
