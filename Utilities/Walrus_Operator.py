# Walrus Operator (:=): the walrus operator allows us to assign values to variables as part of an expression. 
# This is useful for cases where we want to both assign a value and use it in a loop or conditional statement, without needing a separate line for assignment.

# Index 1: Squared 400
# Index 2: Squared 900
# Index 3: Squared 1600
